Hi! I'm Keenan. For those who don't know me, I'm a research student at the University of Sydney and the [Centre for Infectious Diseases & Microbiology Public Health](https://www.wslhd.health.nsw.gov.au/Education-Portal/Research/Research-Categories/Centre-for-infectious-Diseases-and-Microbiology-Public-Health) (CIDM or CIDM Public Health for short. Pronounced sid-um). My fledgling career has been exhilirating so far; full of learning, hard work, and a whole lot of interesting stories. As I get involved in more and more complex ideas and experiments, I've struggled to satisfactorily explain exactly what it is I'm doing to family and friends. So like any good 21st century internet citizen, I thought I'd write a blog. 

With that in mind, this blog is aimed at an audience that has little or no knowledge of microbiology and infectious disease yet. I hope to explain a few topics I find fascinating in a way that's digestible for those who haven't spent a good portion of their lives in science. The first episode (this one) will be all about my degree's main focus: diphtheria and its causative agent.

Many have heard the story of the famous Balto [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balto), a Siberian Husky that led a sled team over a thousand kilometres across Alaska in blizzard conditions. As a child growing up in America, I read stories and watched films [\[2\]](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112453/) regarding this feat and the later foundation of the Iditarod Race. I, however, didn't appreciate the efforts of both man and canine until I came across the story again two decades later. 

For the uninitiated, the 1925 "Great Race of Mercy" was a public health response to a diphtheria epidemic in remote Alaska. The town of Nome was experiencing
